    <h1 class="main-title">Welcome to Part 3: Optinal Delegation</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
        In this part of the experiment, you will decide whether to delegate all allocation decisions in this part to an AI agent or make all decisions yourself. This choice must be made before any round begins and applies to all 10 rounds in this part. Once you make your decision, it cannot be changed.

                    <li><strong>Not delegate</strong> and make every allocation decision yourself for all 10 rounds, similarly to what you did in Part 1.</li>
                    <li><strong>Delegate</strong> all allocation decisions for all 10 rounds to an AI agent and set up this agent just like you did in Part 2.</li>

    <p class="intro-text">
        In this part of the experiment, you will delegate your decisions to an AI agent. This means that instead of making individual allocation decisions in each round yourself, you will provide rule instructions to an AI agent that will make the decisions on your behalf for all 10 rounds in this part.

                <li><strong>Set Your Rules: </strong> Before the 10 rounds begin, you will decide how much you want to allocate to the other participant (the Receiver) in each round by filling up a table.</li>
                <li><strong>Agent Execution: </strong> Based on your instructions, the AI agent will automatically implement these decisions during the rounds. You do not need to interact with the system during these rounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Reshuffled receivers:</strong> Once again, you will be matched with a different human participant (Receiver) in each round.</li>
                <li><strong>Once you are satisfied with your decision:</strong> Click "Confirm" to finalize your agent’s settings. The rule-based AI agent will use your instructions to allocate the money in all 10 rounds exactly as you planned. Once submitted, you will not be able to adjust the AI agent's decisions during the 10 rounds of play.</li>

        In this part of the experiment, you will make allocation decisions yourself for each of the 10 rounds. Unlike other parts, there is no delegation. You will decide how to allocate the bonuses directly between yourself and the other participant in each round.
